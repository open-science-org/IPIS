## How will new researchers acquire OSO tokens?
New resarchers will acquire token:
1) by purchasing from an exchange or any USD/OSO conversion platform
2) by adding value to the ecosystem (e.g. by reviewing the papers, by submitting the errors, by curating the datasets)
3) as a gift from senior researchers (e.g. PhD advisors)

## What would happen if a biotech/pharma buys a large amount of OSO tokens, can they game the system this way?


## Is there a limit to the amount of OSO tokens 1 entity can hold in a wallet?
No


## Will researchers be able to use OSO tokens to fund their own research or research activities?
Yes

### If OSO is traded for outside funds, it breaks the closed loop system of the utility token
